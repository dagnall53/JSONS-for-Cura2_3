# JSONS-for-Cura2_3
Trying to add definitions to Cura2.3 to add a dual extrusion delta 
 
 Save the extruders in /extruders
 Save the printer in /definitions
 
 Currently (5 march 2017) the "machine_extruder_start_code"and "machine_extruder_end_code"
 elements are NOT being processed in Cura 2.4 and are NOT resulting in G code before and after the Extruder switches.
 
 Unclear if this is a Cura issue or something in my coding.
